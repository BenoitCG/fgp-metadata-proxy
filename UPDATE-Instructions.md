In order to support P/T data you will need to update a couple of thesauri in the catalogue. 

Updated thesauri that supports BC data:

* [EC_Government_Titles](https://github.com/federal-geospatial-platform/fgp-metadata-proxy/blob/master/EC_Government_Titles.rdf)
* [EC_Resource_Formats](https://github.com/federal-geospatial-platform/fgp-metadata-proxy/blob/master/EC_Resource_Formats.rdf)

To replace existing thesauri with the ones provided above:

1. log in as Admin
2. Navigate to https://gcgeo.gc.ca/geonetwork/srv/eng/thesaurus.admin
3. Delete `EC_Government_Titles` and `EC_Resource_Formats` thesauri
4. Add the ones referenced above. Accept default settings.
